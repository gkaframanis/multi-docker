- Built a multicontainer application
- We will build a fancy, way more complicated fibonacci sequence calculator.


Request -> Nginx routing to React files for simple html or js files or to the Express Server if trying to access some backend API.

React app communicates with Express Server
The Express server is communicating with Redis and Postgres:
- Redis is in memory data storage and is commonly used for cached values.
(The calculated values)
- Postgres is database. (values I have seen)

- Worker (separate node.js app) watches redis for any new indicies. Pulls each each new indice, caluculates new value, then puts it back into redis.

- Dockerfiles

cd client
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .
docker run -it 1fd34214c883

cd ../server
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .

cd ../worker
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .

- Docker Compose files 

Multi Container Setup 
- Steps
    * Push code to GitHub
    * Travis automatically pulls repo 
    * Travis  builds a test image, tests code 
    * Travis builds prod images 
    * Travis pushes built prod images to Docker Hub 
    * Travis pushes project to AWS EB 
    * EB pulls images from Docker Hub, deploys
